## Contributing to a new attack technique

Stratus Red Team is opinionated in the attack techniques it packages - see [Philosophy](./attack-techniques/philosophy.md). Feel free to open an issue to discuss ideas about new attack techniques. You can see the current backlog using the GitHub issue label [`new-technique`](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew-technique).

## Contributing to the core of Stratus Red Team

When contributing to the core of Stratus Red Team (i.e. anything that is not a new attack technique), include unit tests if applicable.
